# Data Structures
The projects from my Data Structures course 3rd semester. We used the C programming language.

## Project 1
A small C library that implements a number of functions to get a better understanding of the basic data types in C.

## Project 2
A collection of C functions that operate like **arrays** used to understand the underlying properties of **arrays**, their strengths and weaknesses.

## Project 3
A collection of C functions that operate on **linked lists** used to understand the underlying properties of **linked lists**, their strengths and weaknesses.

## Project 4
A collection of C functions that operate on **ordered binary trees** used to understand the underlying properties of **ordered binary trees**, their strengths and weaknesses.

## Project 5
A collection of C functions that operate on **hash tables** used to understand the underlying properties of **hash tables**, their strengths and weaknesses.

## Project 6
A program that performs a complex data base operation using **hash tables, arrays, and sets**.

## Project 7
A program that works with **hash tables** and **graphs**, used to create a Misere nim player that never makes a mistake.
